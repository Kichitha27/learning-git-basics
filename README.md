Branch Explanation-## Git Branches

A branch in Git is a separate line of development that allows you to work on changes without affecting the main code.

Teams use branches so multiple people can work on different features or fixes at the same time safely.

For example, a feature branch is used when developing a new login feature while the main branch stays stable.
